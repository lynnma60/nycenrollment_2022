    Enrollment in New York City public schools has fallen once again, but this time more sharply than in the previous year. Data released by the NYC Department of Education (DOE) show the number of students enrolled in grades kindergarten through 12 
    has fallen by 51,877 from the 2020-2021 academic year to 2021-2022. From 2019-2020 to 2020-2021, the number fell by 34,402. 
    Enrollment has been falling since before the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has been declining more sharply in the last two academic years.

   <p>More specifically, schools with students who have a higher economic need are confronted with a more drastic decrease in enrollment numbers than in schools with students who have less economic hardship. NYC public schools are funded according to number of students, which means the falling enrollment leads to budget cuts.

    There is a list of reasons that attribute to this pattern, according to David Bloomfield, a professor at Brooklyn College for Education Leadership, Law & Policy. There has been a decline in the birth rate, people are moving out of the city, some are opting for other types of schooling such as homeschooling, and some parents decided that they do not trust the public schools in their neighborhoods.

    Daniel Weisberg, the First Deputy Chancellor of the DOE, said the goal is to figure out what families want from the schools, and then meet those demands. As of now, the department is answering calls for more gifted and talented programs, additional and active superintendents, and offering screening in certain schools, among other actions.
   </p>
   <p> “The key is to gain back the trust of families,” said Weisberg.
